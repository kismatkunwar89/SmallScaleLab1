# SmallScaleLab1
This Python script extracts and sorts the relevant geographic data associated with the suspect and victim's cell IDs into a new Excel file, filtering it from the large dataset obtained from the OpenCell database

"The test4.py is the final script"

Note : Could have been done with just random search in database file but it can be extended to make it userfriendly in future making task much easier and faster .
